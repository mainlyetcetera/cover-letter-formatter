Dear Awesome Atlassian People,

My name is Eric Campbell. I am applying for your opening for a Full Stack Engineer working on Trello. This is the perfect opportunity to continue expanding my full stack skills while working on a product I am familiar with and a team I have respected for years!

I feel I can add value to your company as I have used Trello extensively! I know its quirks in terms of keyboard shortcuts and how you can already effectively move cards between boards! I have enjoyed connecting Trello to tools like Zapier to integrate Trello with GitHub Issues! I have also built several full stack apps in the past. The simplest I have done was a ToDo app utilizing React, Express and PostgreSql. I prioritized making sure that it was updating live, so any change to the server would update the DOM; that needed React hooks lifecycle methods to achieve properly.

But the real reason I want to work with your company is what you have shown in your 5 values: a commitment to doing right by your people, both your devs and your customers! I particularly appreciate "Open company, no bullshit" for encouraging whole-company collaboration and "Don't #@!% the customer" as it shows you remember that who we're building these products for! I also love the 1% pledge as a healthy commitment to giving back to your community!

I look forward to moving through the interview process and getting to know you all better!

Sincerely,
Eric Campbell, your next future dev!
